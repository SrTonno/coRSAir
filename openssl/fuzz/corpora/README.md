The Corpora of the OpenSSL Fuzzing Data
=======================================

This repository contains the OpenSSL fuzz regression testing data and
it is supposed to be used as a submodule of the main git repository
checkout.

The reason for the separation as a submodule is that there is a huge
number of files which would make cloning the main OpenSSL source code
repository too much resource-consuming.
